			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
			<p>From my experience and realized while working in different careers is that I like to bring color into the work that I do. No matter the circumstances my whole mood is to lighten up the place
				by not making it feel like a job but a place we like to be and belong with a team. By doing so traits that I have a passion on carrying into work places is humor, teamwork, and loyalty.
				I've noticed that it not only makes me but others around feel more comfortable. Most places I've worked I had applied for one position but had worked for around 3-4 others because of short staff
				No worries here tho! Ya girl is a super floater.

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>It has been a very intaking week, the learning pace is managable but also a little different than what I'm used to. I like the set up of teaching, however
			I don't have much experience with coding so everything is new to me. I try my best to take as much notes, ask quetions, or listen to others questions for others
			have the same as what I am thinking. Do need to study up more on readings. Other than that, I find myself more interested everyday.</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>N/A.
